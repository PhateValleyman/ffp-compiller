For historical reasons, international text is often encoded using a language or
country dependent character encoding. With the advent of the internet and the
frequent exchange of text across countries - even the viewing of a web page
from a foreign country is a "text exchange" in this context -, conversions
between these encodings have become important. They have also become a problem,
because many characters which are present in one encoding are absent in many
other encodings. To solve this mess, the Unicode encoding has been created.
It is a super-encoding of all others and is therefore the default encoding
for new text formats like XML.
