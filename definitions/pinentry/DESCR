The PIN-Entry package contains a collection of simple PIN or pass-phrase entry
dialogs which utilize the Assuan protocol as described by the Ägypten project.
PIN-Entry programs are usually invoked by the gpg-agent daemon, but can be run
from the command line as well. There are programs for various text-based and
GUI environments, including interfaces designed for Ncurses (text-based),
Gtk+, Gtk+-2, and Qt-3.
