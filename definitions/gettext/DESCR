GNU `gettext' is an important step for the GNU Translation Project, as it is an
asset on which we may build many other steps. This package offers to
programmers, translators, and even users, a well integrated set of tools and
documentation. Specifically, the GNU `gettext' utilities are a set of tools
that provides a framework to help other GNU packages produce multi-lingual
messages. These tools include a set of conventions about how programs should be
written to support message catalogs, a directory and file naming organization
for the message catalogs themselves, a runtime library supporting the retrieval
of translated messages, and a few stand-alone programs to massage in various
ways the sets of translatable strings, or already translated strings. A special
GNU Emacs mode also helps interested parties in preparing these sets, or
bringing them up to date.
