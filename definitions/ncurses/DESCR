ncurses (new curses library)

Ncurses (new curses) is a programming library that provides an API which 
allows the programmer to write text-based user interfaces in a terminal-
independent manner. It is a toolkit for developing GUI-like application 
software that runs under a terminal emulator. It also optimizes screen 
changes, in order to reduce the latency experienced when using remote shells.

The ncurses library is a free software emulation of curses in System V 
Release 4.0 (SVr4), and more. It uses terminfo format, supports pads and 
color and multiple highlights and forms characters and function-key mapping, 
and has all the other SVr4-curses enhancements over BSD curses. SVr4 curses 
is better known today as X/Open Curses.

This package includes both wide-character and regular ncurses libraries,
with compatibility symlinks for legacy applications.
