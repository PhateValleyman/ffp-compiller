This package implements two system log daemons. The syslogd daemon is an
enhanced version of the standard Berkeley utility program. This daemon is
responsible for providing logging of messages received from programs and
facilities on the local host as well as from remote hosts.

The klogd daemon listens to kernel message sources and is responsible for
prioritizing and processing operating system messages. The klogd daemon can 
run as a client of syslogd or optionally as a standalone program. Klogd can
now be used to decode EIP addresses if it can determine a System.map file.
