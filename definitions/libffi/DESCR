libffi is a foreign function interface library. It provides a C programming
language interface for calling natively compiled functions given information
about the target function at run time instead of compile time. It also
implements the opposite functionality: libffi can produce a pointer to a
function that can accept and decode any combination of arguments defined at
run time.
